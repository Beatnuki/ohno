    <h1>Takeover by Beatnuki</h1>
    <h4>Reported via the Cadelux.lu / Delen Bank public bug bounty program on Intigriti in Report DELENPRIVATEBANK-7004M5RS on 16th September 2024.
    
    Closed as Out of Scope via Intigriti triage on 17th September 2024.
    
    Rereleasing this legitimately acquired asset endangers Cadelux users, colleagues and researchers, as this domain was being leaked in Cadelux's official DNS records,
        was left dangling, and could be effortlessly acquired by anyone through entirely "working as designed" means.
    
    This page is therefore being left up by the whitehat who reported it so as to prevent threat actor activity, 
        and highlight the importance of effective DNS vulnerability research.
    
    Legitimate Delen and Cadelux colleagues are advised to communicate via the Intigriti report in the event of requiring reclamation of this asset.</h4>
